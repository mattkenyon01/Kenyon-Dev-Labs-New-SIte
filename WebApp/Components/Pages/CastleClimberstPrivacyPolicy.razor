            <h3>How the data is collected</h3>
            <p>

            <p>
                There is also some personal information stored within the Castle Climbers database, such as passwords, which are kept secret and safe behind a hash, emails and usernames. All of these personal pieces of information are kept safe by external software.

            <p>
                Through the use of advertisements in the game, third-parties have access to your personal data. Data is collected to ensure that personalised advertisements are shown to the user. This means that ads are more relevant and appeal to the interests of the user. Castle Climbers has no access or control over the ads that are shown, or the data that is collected and used by third-party advertisers.

            <p>
